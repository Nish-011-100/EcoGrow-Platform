![disease-result](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/434633bb-f486-409a-82bc-a466fe955222)# EcoGrow Platform

EcoGrow is a precision agriculture web platform built using Flask and machine learning to assist farmers in making informed decisions. It helps determine the best crop to plant, suggests fertilizers, identifies crop diseases using image recognition, and provides cures. The platform is designed with an intuitive frontend and animated visuals to enhance user engagement and accessibility.

## Features

- Crop Recommendation based on soil type, temperature, humidity, and rainfall
- Fertilizer Suggestion to improve crop yield based on soil and crop type
- Plant Disease Detection using deep learning image classification
- Disease Curing Guidelines to support farmers in treating affected crops
- Responsive Web UI with custom animations and a visually engaging experience

## Machine Learning Models

### 1. Crop Recommendation
- Inputs: N, P, K values, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall
- Model: Random Forest Classifier
- Dataset: Collected from Kaggle and agricultural databases

### 2. Fertilizer Suggestion
- Logic: Custom condition-based mapping using soil nutrients and crop type

### 3. Disease Detection
- Model: Convolutional Neural Network trained on PlantVillage dataset
- Classes: Tomato leaf diseases (e.g., Early Blight, Late Blight, Leaf Mold)
- Input: Leaf image uploaded by the user
